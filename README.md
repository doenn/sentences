# Sentences #

**Sentences**  is a sentence parser which returns the number of words in a sentence, along with the longest word. Accompanying tests are present in the form of unit tests.

The **Sentences** parser was written in Java 10 and unit tests were written with JUnit 5.

## Platforms ##

**Sentences** should compile and execute on most Java 10-compliant systems, but build and test scripts have currently been written on:

* Windows
* Linux (Tested on OpenSUSE)
* Mac (Untested)
